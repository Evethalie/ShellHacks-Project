# ShellHacks Project
 ## What it does
Math Knights is an adaptive math learning game in which you use your math skills to defeat enemies and gain cool Abilities
## How we built it
Math Knights was made in Unity using C#. It has a simple adaptive AI that makes the questions harder as you go on
## Challenges we ran into
This was my first time ever working with AI even one as simple as what I made today. This project also has a lot of moving parts, that I had to make come together. Fixing one bug created another one and sometimes even ending up having to start from scratch.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Going into this I knew that making an entire game by myself would be a daunting challenge, but through frustration and perseverance I managed to finish.
## What we learned
I learned a lot about machine learning and AI.
## What's next for Math Knights
I want to flesh out the game more; add more abilities, characters, enemies etc. This game was the first full game I've worked on and is an important milestone for me in my journey to becoming a full Game Developer. I want to be able to look back at the game years from now and still think that I did a good job.
